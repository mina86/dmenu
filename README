dmenu - dynamic menu
====================
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dmenu you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dmenu
-------------
See the man page for details.


Changes to original dmenu
-------------------------

Compared to the original dmenu, this repository adds tab-completion
for file names.  To enable that feature the executable must be run
with a “-c” flag at which point pressing tab while cursor is at the
end of the entered text and the text consist of multiple words or
contains a slash will invoke file-name expansion for the last word on
the line.

One known-bug is that the code won't deal well with file names that
contain white space character in them.
